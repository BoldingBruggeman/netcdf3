3.6.3          2008-05-31

		In ncdump and ncgen, added CDL support for UTF-8
		encoding of characters in names and for escaped
		special chars in names.  Made sure UTF-8 names are
		normalized using NFC rules before storing or
		comparing.

		Handle IEEE NaNs and infinities in a
		platform-independent way in ncdump output.

	        Added support for ARM representation of doubles,
	        (thanks to Warren Turkal).

	        Fixed bug in C++ API creating 64-bit offset
	        files. (See
	        http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/known_problems.html#cxx_64-bit.)

	        Fixed bug for variables larger than 4 GB. (See
	        http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/known_problems.html#large_vars_362.)

	        Changed the configure.ac to build either 3.6.x or 4.x
	        build from the same configure.ac.

		Build now checks gfortran version and handles it
		cleanly, also Portland Group in Intel fortran, with
		various configurations.

		A Fortran netcdf.inc file is now created at build time, based
		on the setting of --disable-v2. 

		Documentation has been fixed in several places.
	       
	        Upgraded to automake 1.10, autoconf 2.62, and libtool 2.2.2.

	        Includes missing Windows Visual Studio build files.

		Fixed missing include of config.h in a C++ test program.

		Fixed maintainer-clean in man directory.

		Fixed --enable-c-only and make check.

		Fixed behavior when opening a zero-length file.

		Many portability enhancements to build cleanly on
		various platforms. 

		Turned on some old test programs which were not being
		used in the build.

3.6.2          2007-03-05

		Released.

3.6.2 beta6    2007-01-20
		
		Fine tuning of build system to properly handle cygwin,
		Mingw, and strange configuration issues.

		Automake 1.10 has a problem with running our tests on
		MinGW, so I'm switching back to automake 1.9.6 for
		this release.

3.6.2 beta5    2006-12-30

		Now netCDF configuration uses autoconf 2.61, and
		automake 1.10. (Thanks to Ralf Wildenhues for the
		patches, and all the autotools help in general!)

		Final major revision of netCDF tutorial before the
		3.6.2 release.

		Now netCDF builds under MinGW, producing a windows DLL
		with the C and F77 APIs. Use the --enable-shared --enable-dll
		--disable-cxx --disable-f90 flags to configure. (C++
		and F90 have never been built as windows DLLs, but
		might be in a future release if there is user
		interest). This has all been documented in the netCDF
		Porting and Installation Guide.

		Now extreme numbers (i.e. those close to the limits of
		their type) can be turned off in nc_test/nf_test, with
		--disable-extreme-numbers. It is turned off
		automatically for Solaris i386 systems.	

		Added --enable-c-only option to configure. This causes
		only the core netCDF-3 C library to be built. It's the
		same as --disable-f77 --disable-cxx --disable-v2
		--disable-utilities.

		Added --disable-utilities to turn off building and
		testing of ncgen/ncdump.

	        Fix a long-standing bug in nf90_get_att_text() pointed
	        out by Ryo Furue, to make sure resulting string is
	        blank-padded on return.  This is fixed in the
	        Fortran-90 interface, but is impractical to fix in the
	        Fortran-77 interface implemented via cfortran.h.

		Now large file tests are run if --enable-large-file-tests
		is used in the configure.

		For Cray users, the ffio module is used if the
		--enable-ffio option is passed to configure.

	        Unrolled loops in byte-swapping code used on
	        little-endian platforms to reduce loop overhead. This
	        optimization resulted in a 22% speedup for some
	        applications accessing floats or ints (e.g. NCO
	        utilities ncap and ncbo) and a smaller speedup for
	        shorts or doubles.

                Added "-k" option to ncdump and ncgen, for identifying
                and specifying the kind of netCDF file, one of
                "classic", "64-bit-offset", "hdf5", or "hdf5-nc3".
                Removed output of kind of netCDF file in CDL comment
                produced by ncdump.

		Fixed bug of ncdump seg-faulting if invoked
		incorrectly with option like "-c" or "-h" but no file
		name.

3.6.2 beta4    2006-08-15

		Changed F77/F90 man pages from netcdf.3f and
		netcdf.3f90 to netcdf_f77.3 and netcdf_f90.3. Also
		fixed broken install of man pages.

		Changed configure script so that "-g -O2" is no longer
		set as CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and FFLAGS by default if a
		GNU compiler is being used. Now nothing is set.
	
		Changed configure script so that fortran flag is set
		in config.h.

		Updated Installation and Porting Guide, C++
		Interface Guide, F77 and F90 Interface Guides.

		Build with static libraries by default.

		Added configure option --enable-separate-fortran,
		which causes the fortran library to be built
		separately. This is turned on automatically for shared
		libraries.

		Improved clarity of error messages.

		Changed configuration to get cygwin DLL and mingw DLL
		builds working, for the C library only (i.e. no
		F77, F90, or C++ APIs).

		Changed type of ncbyte in C++ interface from unsigned
		char to signed char, for consistency with C interface.
		The C++ documentation warned this change would
		eventually occur.
		
		Changed the C++ interface to use only the netCDF-3 C
		interface instead of the older netCDF-2 C interface.
		This has the added benefit that on-the-fly numeric
		conversions are now supported using get methods, for
		example you can get data of any type as double.  When
		using --disable-v2 flag to configure, the C++
		interface can now be built and installed.

3.6.2 beta3    2006-05-24

		Changed to use default prefix of /usr/local instead of
		package-based prefix of previous releases of
		netCDF. Use the --prefix argument to the configure
		script to override the default.

		Made separate fortran library file, instead of
		appending fortran library functions to the C library
		file, if --enable-separate-fortran is used during
		configure (it's turned on automatically if
		--enable-shared is used). If uses, the fortran API
		users must link to *both* the C library and the new
		fortran library, like this: -lnetcdff -lnetcdf

		Added netCDF examples in C, C++, F77, F90, and
		CDL. See the examples subdirectory.

		Added the NetCDF Tutorial.

		Minor fixes to some of the netCDF documentation.

		Made it possible to build without V2 API using
		--disable-v2 from configure.

		Switched to new build system, with automake and
		libtool. Now shared libraries are built (as well as
		static ones) on platforms which support it. For more
		information about shared libraries, see
		http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/faq.html#shared_intro

		Fixed ncdump crash that happened when no arguments were 
		used.

		Fixed for building with gfortran 4.1.0.

		Important fix for machines whose SIZEOF_SIZE_T !=
		SIZEOF_LONG, such as NEC-SX, thanks to Stephen Leak.

		Fixed C++ on AIX platform.

		Fixed 64-bit builds on AIX platform.

		Removed bad assertion that could be triggered in rare
		cases when reading a small file.

		Added comments in v1hpg.c to clarify purpose of each
		internal function.

		Make sure filesize is determined in nc_close() *after*
		buffers get flushed.

		Fix long-standing problem resulting in files up to 3
		bytes longer than necessary if there is exactly one
		record variable of type byte, char, or short and if
		the number of values per record for that variable is
		not divisible by 4 (or 2 in the case of short).  Now
		the filesize determined from header info by
		NC_calcsize should be correct in all cases.

3.6.1           2006-01-31

		Updated installation manual for 3.6.1.
	
		Changed installation to try to provide correct
		compiler flags for compiling in 64-bit mode on Sun,
		Irix, AIX, and HPUX. (HPUX doesn't work for me,
		however). Now run configure with --enable-64bit to get
		a 64 bit compile.
		
		Fixed long-standing bug that would cause small netCDF
		files to be padded on the end with zero bytes to 4096
		bytes when they were opened and changed.  Now small
		files should stay small after you change a value.

		Fixed bug in assertions in putget.c that would only be
		noticed if you change the manifest constant
		NC_MAX_DIMS in netcdf.h to be different from
		NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS.

		Moved test ftest.F from fortran to nf_test directory,
		and fixed bug in ftest.F which caused it to return 0
		even if tests failed (no tests were failing,
		however). Also renamed some test
		output files to make things a little clearer.

		If open for writing, pad with up to 3 extra zero bytes
		before close to the correct canonical length,
		calculated from the header.  Previously files could be
		short due to not padding when writing in NOFILL mode.

		Doubled arbitrary limits on number of dimensions,
		variables, attributes, and length of names.

		Change name of nc_get_format() to nc_inq_format().
		Add analogous interfaces for nf_inq_format(),
		nf90_inquire(), and NcFile::get_format() to f77, f90,
		and C++ interfaces.  Document new function in texinfo
		files.  Add minimal test to nc_test, nf_test.

3.6.1-beta3     2005-02-17

		Added function nc_get_format(int ncid, int* formatp)
		that returns either NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC or
		NC_FORMAT_64BIT for a CDF1 or CDF2 file, respectively.

		Added test to nc_test that detects whether format
		version was changed after a file is reopened and
		define mode is entered.

		Correctly configure for Intel ifort Fortran compiler on Linux.

3.6.0-p1        2005-02-18

		Fixed bug that changes CDF2 files to CDF1 files if CDF2
                file is reopened for write access and either an
		attribute is changed or define mode is entered.

3.6.1-beta2     2005-1-6
	
		Fixed absoft compile problem. Maybe.

3.6.1-beta1     2005-1-3

		Fixed Cygwin C++ problem.

		Fixed large file problem in MS Visual C++.NET environment.

		More information in installation and porting guide.

3.6.0           2004-12-16

                Added texinfo source for the documentation.

                Added large file tests to Windows directory in distribution.

                Modified win32 visual studio project files so that m4
                is no longer required to build netcdf under visual studio.

                Modified rules.make to use install instead of cp,
                fixing install problem for cygwin users.
                
                Modified configure/install stuff to support HP-UX.

                Modified configure/install stuff to support G95.
        
                In the f90 interface, applied Arnaud Desitter's fixes
                to correct mismatches between scalar and array
                arguments, eliminating (legitimate) complaints by the
                NAGWare f95 compiler.  Also fixed bugs introduced in
                3.6.0-beta5 in the mapped array interfaces.

3.6.0-beta6     2004-10-05

                Fixed AIX 64-bit/largefile install problems.

                Removed FAQ section from netcdf.texi User's Guide, in
                deference to online version that can be kept up to
                date more easily.

3.6.0-beta5     2004-10-04

                Fixed assertion violation on 64-bit platforms when
                size of last fixed size variable exceeds 2^32 - 1.

                Removed another restriction on file size by making
                record size (derived from other sizes, not part of the
                format) an off_t instead of a size_t, when an off_t is
                larger than a size_t.  This permits records to be
                *much* larger in either classic format or
                64-bit-offset format.

                Incorporated patch from Mathis Rosenhauer to improve
                performance of Fortran 90 interface for calls to
                nf90_put_var_TYPE(), nf90_get_var_TYPE(),
                nf90_put_vara_TYPE(), and nf90_get_vara_TYPE()
                functions by not emulating them with the corresponding
                nf90_put_varm_TYPE() and nf90_get_varm_TYPE() calls.

                Added tests for invalid offsets in classic format when
                defining multiple large variables.

                Improved installation ease.  Have configure script use
                Large File Support as a default, if available.

                Add "extra_test" as a target for testing Large File
                Support.
